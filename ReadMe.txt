Rotating Cube in VPython
This is a simple project that demonstrates how to create a rotating cube using the VPython library. 
The cube rotates randomly around the x and y axes, and the rotation speed can be adjusted by changing a single variable in the script.

Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have VPython installed on your computer. You can install VPython using pip:"pip install vpython"

Usage
To run the script, simply run the rotating_cube.py file in your Python environment. The cube should appear on your screen and begin rotating immediately.
You can adjust the speed of rotation by changing the rotation_speed variable at the top of the rotating_cube.py file.
The rotation speed is measured in degrees per frame, so a higher value will make the cube rotate more quickly.
